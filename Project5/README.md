Project 5 - Model Loader
Joshua Bayt

- CONTROLS -
    Use Arrow keys to rotate objects.
    Use Left mouse click to toggle between models

This project uses OpenGL Glut to load .OBJ Files into models with a texture applied.
Only three models are loaded (cube, trunk, bunny) -- and only one is rendered at a time.
This project takes awhile to load, please be patient.

- BUILD -
    This project only contains one source (cpp) file in the src/ directory. Thus it can be compiled easily through CMD. However, you can also run the provided Makefile using command "make" or "make debug". In addition, you can also use "make clean" to clean the directory. This Makefile will auto create any missing folders (Windows only!). 
    Requires a root /common/ folder
